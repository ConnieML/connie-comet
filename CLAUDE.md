# Connie.one Project Context

## Project Overview
- Next.js/Payload CMS project for connie.one
- Connie is a startup CPAAS for nonprofits (digital transformation, ops efficiency, scale impact)
- Main CPAAS at https://connie.team (Twilio Flex backend)
- Tenant portal at https://portal.connie.team (uses Okta + My Apps)
- Currently evaluating authentication for connie.one dataroom
- Project structure includes main site, dataroom feature, and CMS admin

## Current Status
- **Authentication**: âœ… COMPLETED - Okta integration successfully implemented
- **Footer**: âœ… COMPLETED - 3-column layout with CMS management
- **Latest Update**: Waitlist page with animated grid backgrounds (Aug 16, 2024)

## Key Technical Components
- Next.js frontend with Payload CMS
- Dataroom feature for document access
- Theme system with light/dark modes
- File structure includes collections (Users, Posts, Pages, Media)

## IMPORTANT: Development Guidelines
**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Review PayloadCMS Documentation Before Any Material Code Changes**
- **PayloadCMS Docs**: https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/what-is-payload
- ALL agents must review relevant PayloadCMS documentation before making material edits
- Understand collections, fields, hooks, and API patterns before implementing
- Follow PayloadCMS best practices for schema design and data modeling
- Consult specific sections: Collections, Fields, Admin UI, REST API, GraphQL API
- Risk tolerance is very low - improper CMS changes can break production

**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Git Commit Guidelines**
- NEVER include Claude/AI advertising in commit messages
- Keep commit messages professional and focused on the technical changes
- User is paying for this service and will give credit when appropriate
- Focus on clear, descriptive commit messages without promotional content

## Current Discussion
- Evaluating Okta vs other authentication providers
- Business case for Okta needs to be documented and analyzed
- Previous session was interrupted during explanation of Okta rationale

## Okta Business Case & Technical Context
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Already using Okta for main platform (portal.connie.team)
- **SAML 2.0 Integration**: Established workflow with Twilio Flex via SAML SSO
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Each CBO tenant accesses via Okta My Apps â†’ their Flex instance
- **Security Requirements**: Dataroom contains sensitive stakeholder content requiring robust auth
- **Consistency**: Connie.one would align with existing identity management infrastructure
- **Cost Advantage**: Connie is a nonprofit with full Okta subsidization - no additional cost
- **Previous Integration Challenges**: Failed attempt at Okta SAML2.0 + PayloadCMS integration (resulted in full restart)
- **Risk Tolerance**: Very low - cannot afford to break existing connie.one work
- **CI/CD Setup**: Working pipeline to AWS Amplify (must protect)
- **Existing Okta OIDC**: Previous setup exists from failed integration attempt
- **Simple Role Requirements**: 
  - Admin role: "Connie Admins" Okta group (~4 users) - full CMS + dataroom access
  - Dataroom role: Stakeholders (dataroom access only)
- **Preferred Login Flow**: portal.connie.team â†’ My Apps â†’ Connie.one â†’ /admin or /dataroom
- **Integration Goal**: Connie.one as available app in Okta My Apps dashboard
- **Technical Approach**: Previous agent suggested NextAuth + Okta (safer than direct SAML)
- **Existing Technical Details**: 
  - Entity ID: urn:flex:JQ5c7c65eb72a5114214e803ba4f36f525
  - ACS URL: https://login.flex.us1.twilio.com/login/callback?connection=JQ5c7c65eb72a5114214e803ba4f36f525
  - JIT provisioning enabled for automatic user creation
  - Flex roles: agent, supervisor, administrator
  - Enhanced OAuth 2.0 framework via Okta

## Current Okta Setup (from screenshots)
- **My Apps Dashboard**: Shows existing Connie apps in "Work" section
  - ASA.CONNIE.TEAM, hhovy.connie.team, Nevada Senior Services, southside.connie.team, ConnieOne-Admin
  - Development section: Enhanced SSO Dev, ConnieRTC(+Flex)-DevSandBox, Okta Workflows
- **Admin Dashboard**: 43 users, 16 groups, 21 SSO apps (12 OIDC, 8 SAML, 0 Others)
- **Goal**: Add "Connie.one" app to My Apps that redirects to connie.one/admin

## FINAL Implementation Plan - Clerk + Payload + Okta Integration

### Why Clerk is the Right Solution
âœ… **Official Okta SAML SSO support** - Clerk has built-in enterprise Okta integration  
âœ… **Proven Payload integration** - Community-documented approach that works  
âœ… **Maintains SSO dream** - portal.connie.team â†’ My Apps â†’ Connie.one via Clerk  
âœ… **Production-ready** - No custom authentication code to maintain  
âœ… **Future-proof** - Follows documented patterns from both Clerk and Payload  

### Step 1: Clerk Setup & Okta SAML Integration
1. **Create Clerk application** for connie.one
2. **Configure Okta SAML connection** in Clerk dashboard:
   - Add Okta Workforce as SAML connection
   - Configure domain matching for your organization
   - Map "Connie Admins" group to Clerk roles
3. **Test Clerk + Okta flow** independently

### Step 2: Environment Variables
```env
# Clerk Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

# Existing Payload Configuration (keep)
DATABASE_URI=mongodb+srv://...
PAYLOAD_SECRET=...
```

### Step 3: Install & Configure Clerk
1. **Install Clerk**: `pnpm add @clerk/nextjs`
2. **Add ClerkProvider** to layout
3. **Create sign-in/sign-up pages**
4. **Protect admin routes** with Clerk middleware

### Step 4: Clerk-Payload Integration
1. **Create Clerk token verification utility** for Payload API
2. **Modify Payload auth** to accept Clerk tokens
3. **Sync Clerk users** with Payload users collection
4. **Map Clerk roles** to Payload permissions

### Step 5: Updated Login Flow
**NEW FLOW:** portal.connie.team â†’ My Apps â†’ Connie.one â†’ **Clerk (handles Okta SAML)** â†’ Payload Admin

### Step 6: Benefits of Clerk Approach
âœ… **Zero custom authentication code**  
âœ… **Official Okta enterprise SSO**  
âœ… **Documented Payload integration pattern**  
âœ… **Handles all OAuth complexity**  
âœ… **Secure token-based API authentication**  
âœ… **Scalable for multiple auth providers**

### Step 7: Production Deployment
1. **Update Okta SAML settings** to production domain
2. **Configure Clerk production environment**
3. **Deploy to AWS Amplify** with new env vars

## AWS Amplify Production Deployment Configuration

## Waitlist Page Implementation (Aug 16, 2024)

### Challenge
User wanted a waitlist page with animated dot matrix background. Initial attempts to manually position dots failed repeatedly - dots only appeared in one row, positioning was broken, visibility issues.

### Solution
Instead of manual HTML/CSS, we used professional third-party components:

1. **Magic UI Animated Grid Pattern** (`/src/blocks/WaitlistLanding`)
   - Installed via: `npx shadcn@latest add "https://magicui.design/r/animated-grid-pattern"`
   - Creates animated squares that fade in/out randomly
   - Perfect metaphor for "community connections lighting up"
   - Component at: `/src/components/magicui/animated-grid-pattern.tsx`

2. **Aceternity-style Static Grid** (`/src/blocks/WaitlistStatic`)
   - Clean grid lines with radial gradient fade
   - More professional/established feel
   - Muted slate color palette with blue-purple gradient text
   - Slimmed down form with "Stay Informed" CTA (less commitment than "Join Waitlist")

### Key Features Added
- **Layout Control**: Pages can now be "Standard" (with header/footer) or "Landing" (without)
  - Field added to Pages collection: `layoutType`
  - Root layout conditionally renders based on this field
- **Two Waitlist Blocks**: User can A/B test animated vs static grid
- **Full-width blocks**: Hero, RawHTML, and Waitlist blocks render without margins

### Files Created/Modified
- `/src/blocks/WaitlistLanding/` - Animated grid component
- `/src/blocks/WaitlistStatic/` - Static grid component  
- `/src/collections/Pages/index.ts` - Added new blocks and layout control
- `/src/blocks/RenderBlocks.tsx` - Added new components to renderer
- `/src/app/(frontend)/layout.tsx` - Conditional header/footer rendering

### Deployment Considerations
- New dependency: `motion` (for Magic UI component)
- Both blocks are production-ready
- No additional environment variables needed
- Content must be added via PayloadCMS admin after deployment

## Notes
- Project has test setup with Playwright and Vitest
- Footer enhancements ready for production deployment
- CMS content (footer columns) must be added separately on production after deployment
- **CRITICAL**: Deployment is fragile - previous attempts took hours. Review deployment section carefully!
